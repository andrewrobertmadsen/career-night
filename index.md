# Welcome To Career Night!

As a Aaronic Priesthood Quorum we're going to be discussing careers with the boys this Wednesday, March 10th.
The goal of the career night is to gain exposure to different career options and learn a little about the compensation and lifestyle associated with that career.
As part of this activity, each boy will be asked to share some information they have gathered about their assigned career with the group.

## Instructions

1. Pick a random number between 1 and 100.
2. Look up the number you chose to in the [career list](career_list.md)
